I have organised Terraform scripts into modules for each component.

modules-> vpc(For provision VPC with internet gateway and netgateway),
	  sg(security group for rds and eks nodes), 
	  eks(For provsion eks cluster with node group), 
	  helm(For for deploy wordpress in eks cluster), 
	  rds(For provsion rds),
	  memecache(for provsion elastic cache)
	  	  

from root main.tf file you can pass variable parameter for modules.
I have provision wordpress site on eks cluster using terraform with self-sign ssl certificate.

To provision whole infra and wordpress site run below commands.

Preinstall tools

Terraform, helm, kubectl, awscli, certbot

#To initialize and install all dependencies
Terraform init

#To Plan and check which resources terraform code provision
Terraform plan

#After check everything provision insta
terraform apply

it will provsion whole infra with rds and memecache.

Now configure cluster with your local using kubeconfig file.
run the below command to download kubeconfig file.

aws eks --region <region> update-kubeconfig --name <cluster_name>

now uncomment wordpress code in modules/helm/main.tf and run terraform apply command again.

After the deployment you will get load balancer url. using it you can access wordpress site.

first edit /etc/host file with your domain to access wordpress application on local domain name.
like below configuration-

<load balancer public ip>   narotamproject.com


Now you can access wordpress application on local domain name.

Now we have to create self sign ssl on for local domain using lets Encrpt.using below command.

 sudo certbot certonly -d narotamproject.com
 
 after the all detail filling we will get certificate in /etc/letsencrypt/live/ path.
 
 now  configure this in nginx config file with domain and you can access service with ssl on local.
